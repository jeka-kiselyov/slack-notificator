# slack-notificator
Messages from few Slack teams in single browser window. With desktop notifications. MIT licensed.

App stores auth keys only in your browser localStorage ([check out the code](https://github.com/jeka-kiselyov/slack-notificator/blob/master/scripts/slackAuth.js)). So:

 - Don't worry much about security on the application side.
 - You need to auth teams on every other device you use. But it's fast, takes 2 clicks only.
