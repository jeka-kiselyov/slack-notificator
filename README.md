# slack-notificator
Messages from few Slack teams in single browser window. With desktop notifications. MIT licensed.

Auth Keys is stored only in your browser localStorage ([check out the code](https://github.com/jeka-kiselyov/slack-notificator/blob/master/scripts/slackAuth.js)). So:

 - Don't worry about security from App side.
 - You need to auth teams on every device. But it's ok as it takes 2 clicks.
